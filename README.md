# Product-Authenticity-Check
Product Authenticity Check is a project to help luxurious brands deal with the issue of duplicate products in the market.
The manufacturer can tag each product with a unique serial number. A QR code is created for this serial number. A customer can then validate the product by scanning the QR and entering the serial number in the web application. The presence of the serial number is checked in the product database and the product details are displayed. 
AWS services have been used to implement this.
